# XamarinFirstApp

Xamarin Cross-Plataform MvvM pattern

I did this model through the following tutorial:

NinjaTips | Xamarin Fomrs: Creando una app desde cero

It's basically a testing of navigation properties through XAML pages using a main menu and MVVM model.
I will yet implement the database using SQLLite.
Haven't done it yet, because the tutorial goes along with Azure, and I don't have any Azure account.
